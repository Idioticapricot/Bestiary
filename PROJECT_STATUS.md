## üõ†Ô∏è TECHNICAL SUGGESTIONS

### Smart Contract Development
- **Framework**: Use Hardhat for development and testing
- **Language**: Solidity ^0.8.19 for latest features
- **Libraries**: OpenZeppelin for secure contract templates
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage with Mocha/Chai

### Backend Architecture
- **API**: Node.js with Express or Python with FastAPI
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and leaderboards
- **Queue**: Bull/BullMQ for background job processing

### Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: AWS/Vercel for frontend, Railway/Render for backend
- **Storage**: IPFS (Pinata/Web3.Storage) for beast images
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for error tracking, DataDog for metrics
