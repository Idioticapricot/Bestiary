# NFT Contract Deployment Guide for Avalanche Fuji Testnet

## 🚨 **IMPORTANT: Your contract address is not deployed on Fuji testnet!**

The error you're seeing (`CALL_EXCEPTION`) means the contract at address `0xb8433deCc52A3a08600d6A13CfA161849C7a27Ee` is not deployed on Avalanche Fuji testnet.

## 🔧 **Quick Fix Options:**

1. **Get test AVAX** from [Avalanche Faucet](https://faucet.avax.network/)
2. **Deploy your MyNFT contract** to Fuji testnet
3. **Update the contract address** in your app

### **Option 2: Use a Test Contract**

I can help you deploy a simple test NFT contract to Fuji testnet.

### **Option 3: Test on Local Network**

Deploy to a local Hardhat network for testing.

## 📋 **What You Need:**

1. **Core Wallet** with test AVAX
2. **Your MyNFT contract** (from `contracts/MyNFT.sol`)
3. **Remix IDE** or **Hardhat** for deployment

## 🚀 **Deploy with Remix (Easiest):**

1. **Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)**
2. **Upload your MyNFT.sol file**
3. **Compile the contract**
4. **Deploy to Fuji testnet:**
   - Environment: `Injected Provider - MetaMask`
   - Network: Avalanche Fuji Testnet (Chain ID: 43113)
   - Click "Deploy"
5. **Copy the deployed contract address**
6. **Update your app** with the new address

## 🔍 **Verify Your Contract:**

After deployment, verify it's working:
1. **Click "🔍 Test Contract Deployment"** in your app
2. **Should show "Contract found on blockchain!"**
3. **Click "🧪 Test Wallet Connection"**
4. **Should show "Wallet connection test passed!"**

## 📝 **Update Your App:**

Replace the contract address in your app:
```typescript
const CONTRACT_ADDRESSES = {
  fuji: "0x...", // Your NEW deployed contract address
  mainnet: "0x...",
}
```
